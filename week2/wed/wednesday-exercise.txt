Go line by line, and explain what's happening in each line.

int score = 80; // A variable of type int and of name score is declared and is assigned a value of 80;

String result; This is declaring the variable a string. 

if (score == 80) { This a conditional statement that states if score is compared to 80 it is true. It is the reference of a variable in the memory address.
	result = "You passed!"; This block of code is the result from the condition
} else if (score > 80) { This is a contdition that states the condition is true if score is greater than 80.
	result = "You did great!"; This is the result that is return if the score is greater than 80.
} else {
	result = "You did not pass. Try again!"; this is the block of code that prints if the conditions are false.
}

System.out.println(result);is used to print an argument that is passed to it. The result will print true in this case.
