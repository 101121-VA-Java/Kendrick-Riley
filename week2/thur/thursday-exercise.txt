public static void main(String[] args) { This is the main method.The word public is the access modifier. Static is a keyword which is associated with a method and it 
deals with scoop. Void means that it does not return a value. Main is indicating that it is the main method in java. Strings args pass in an argument which is an Array.
	String[] foodTypes = getFoodTypes(); This is a string array. FoodTypes is the variable and it is a string. GetFood types is the return value.
	String myType = foodTypes[2];String myType is a way to declare a variable. Equals is giving foodtypes a value and initialize it.

	String[] foodsOfMyType = getFoodsByType(myType); This is a String array that have FoodsOfMytype as a variable. Equals means you are giving it the get
FoodsByType(myType) value. Therefore, you are declaring and initializing it.
	
	for (String food : foodsOfMyType) { This a a for loop that has a type string with a variable of food; it loops through the foodsofMyType
		System.out.println(food); This is a java statemnt that prints the arguments that are passed into the system.
	} Curly braces
}

public static String[] getFoodTypes() { This a public method that takes in a string array called getFoodTypes.
	String[] foodTypes = {"breakfast","lunch","dinner","dessert","snack"};This is a string Array that have a variable called foodTypes. This array has five strings

	return foodTypes; This returns a value from footypes.
}

public static String[] getFoodsByType(String type) {This a public method that has a string array as its type.
	String[] foods = new String[3];Here we have a string array called foods. We intialized it and declared it at position three in the array.

	switch(type) { This a control flow type. Its a way dispatch execution to other parts of the code.
	case "breakfast": This is the first case to the code. If the type is breakfast it runs the block code.
		foods[0] = "pancakes";this is showing the location of the string name at that location.
		foods[1] = "cereal";this is showing the location of the string name at that location
		foods[2] = "omelette";this is showing the location of the string name at that location
		break; This halts the excecution of the code.
	case "lunch":this is the first to the code. If the type is lunch it runs the block code.
		foods[0] = "sandwich";this is showing the location of the string name at that location.
		foods[1] = "salad";this is showing the location of the string name at that location.
		foods[2] = "soup";this is showing the location of the string name at that location.
		break; Java break statement.his halts the excecution of the code.
	case "dinner":is is the first to the code. If the type is dinner it runs the block code.

		foods[1] = "ice cream";this is showing the location of the string name at that location.
		foods[2] = "candy";this is showing the location of the string name at that location.

		foods[1] = "apple";this is showing the location of the string name at that location.
		foods[2] = "samosa";this is showing the location of the string name at that location.

	default: Is use when none of the other case was meet.
		// add your own. this a commit line
		break; this halts the excecution of the code

	return foods; this returns the value of string.
